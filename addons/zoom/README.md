# Zoom

Allows users to override the min/max zoom distances (of the mouse wheel) to see closer or further away from their character.

NOTE: This only works with the mouse wheel. Using the numberpad `9` and `3` will still be capped at their original defaults.

## Usage

- `/zoom`: to print out the current zoom levels
- `/zoom setout [num]`: sets the zoom-out level
- `/zoom setin [num]`: sets the zoom-in level
