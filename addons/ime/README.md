# IME

IME is an addon that enables the use of the Japanese character set and IME toolbar while on the English or European client. (Requires additional external setup to fully work!)

# Commands

IME exposes the following commands:

  * **/ime setlang \<id\>** - _Sets the client language. (0 = JP, 1 = NA, 2 = EU, 3 = EU)_

_Please note: Setting the client language with the above command is not required and just optional. It will alter how some of the client operates when changed. Such as NPCs will talk in the language set._

# Requirements

In order for this addon to function properly, you must do some additional steps first. Depending on your operating system, some of these steps may be optional. (For Windows 10, these are all required.)

If you are prompted to choose which parts of the language pack to install, be sure to install at least the 'Display Language' and 'Typing'. (Best to install all features of the language for best results.)
