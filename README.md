# Ashita v4 Open Beta

Ashita v4's development started a few years ago but was never pushed as something serious until last year. v3 has been very stable and solid for the time being, and until we felt a need for a new version came, we didn't start pushing forward with v4. When we decided to revamp the event callbacks and restructure the Addon framework, we began more serious development on v4, which started late 2019 into 2020.

On May 24th, 2020 we opened the beta testing of v4 to all who were interested in our first stage of open beta testing. Users can still join the open beta now and until we have fully released v4 officially. To join, you must be a member of our Discord and join the beta group.

Once on the Discord server, you can join the beta group by using the `.betatester` command in any channel. Simply type this as a normal message and our bot will get you added to the proper group. From there you will be able to see a set of new beta tester channels.
