## Ashita SDK

The Ashita SDK (found within /Ashita/Data/plugins/sdk/) is licensed under the GNU LGPL v3. 

  * Please refer to the bullet points above for important license terms.

  > **Please Note** 
  >
  > The Ashita SDK is licensed under the LGPL instead of the full GPL, allowing plugins to be released without having to release their source code.
  >
  > However, modifications to the SDK itself must be released with your plugin if any are made. *(Plugin authors should not need to alter the SDK specifically for a plugin. If you feel something needs to be changed in the SDK, please either make a feature request report or create a pull request with your suggested change.)*
