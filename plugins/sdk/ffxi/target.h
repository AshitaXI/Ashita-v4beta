    target_t Notes

        SubTargetFlags - This byte flag holds the valid target types that an action or spell can be used to target something with.
                         The bytes set depend on how an action is used. Either via the menu, typed or used with a <st> style token.

        MouseDistanceX
        MouseDistanceY - These are used to determine the distance of mouse from the center of the screen outward. The center of the
                         screen is considered 0, 0. The range is from -1 to 1 on both axis.
